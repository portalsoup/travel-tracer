# travel-tracer
Trace and record long distance trips

Travel Tracer will one day be a helpful, partially automatic traveling buddy to monitor and catalog a full time traveler's 
long trip using their mobile device's onboard sensors

Currently the only sample endpoints made playing around so far is:

localhost:8080/map/point?latitude=41.877120&longitude=-87.630539 to render a map showing a marker at these coordinates

and

localhost:8080/map/route to render a map displaying a route using hardcoded waypoints.
