# travel-tracer
Trace and record long distance trips

Travel Tracer will one day be a helpful, partially automatic traveling buddy to monitor and catalog a full time traveler's 
long trip using their mobile device's onboard sensors

Currently the only sample endpoint I've made playing around so far is:

localhost:8080/point-map?latitude=value&longitude=value

Such as: 

localhost:8080/point-map?latitude=41.877120&longitude=-87.630539
