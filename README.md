# travel-tracer
Trace and record long distance trips

Travel Tracer will one day be a helpful, partially automatic traveling buddy to monitor and catalog a full time traveler's 
long trip using their mobile device's onboard sensors

Currently the only sample endpoint made playing around so far is:

localhost:8080/map/point?latitude=41.877120&longitude=-87.630539

and

localhost:8080/map/route


Immediate Todo:

Hook up database

Able to store routes in database

Able to view routes from database

Decide whether to move forward with google maps or openstreetmap
